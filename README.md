# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Classification â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **binary classification workflow** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** (built into scikit-learn).  

It includes two approaches commonly used by Machine Learning Engineers:
- âœ… **Scikit-learn pipeline** with Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- âœ… **TensorFlow/Keras neural network (MLP)**
